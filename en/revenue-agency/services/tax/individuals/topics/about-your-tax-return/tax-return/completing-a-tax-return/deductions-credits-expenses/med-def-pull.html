      <p>Michael stayed in a hotel nearby and during the day, helped her with meals and personal care at the hospital. Michael drove his mother back to Sydney afterwards.</p>
      <p>Maria can claim all reasonable travel expenses for herself and her son while en route, to and from Halifax and for the 2-week period of medical services in Halifax.</p>
      <p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
      <p>Jennifer had to travel from Prince Rupert to Vancouver (over 80 kilometres one way) to get medical services. Her husband Stephen drove her there. Jennifer stayed in the hospital in Vancouver for 3 weeks but Stephen drove back to Prince Rupert after dropping her off at the hospital.

      <p>Since similar medical services were not available near her home, Jennifer took a direct travelling route, and it was reasonable, under the circumstances, for her to travel to Vancouver to get medical services.</p>
      <p>Stephen came to visit Jennifer once during her 3-week stay in the hospital. When Jennifer was ready to go home, Stephen drove to Vancouver to take her home.</p>
      <p>Jennifer can claim reasonable travel expenses for herself and her husband for the trip from Prince Rupert to Vancouver and then for the drive back home. However, neither Jennifer nor Stephen can claim any expenses for the trip Stephen made to visit Jennifer in the hospital.</p>

      <summary>Example - Travel at least 80 kilometres and outside of Canada</summary>
          <p>John had to travel from Winnipeg to Germany (over 80 kilometres one way) to get medical services. He flew there and back, and stayed at a hotel for one week while he received the services from a medical practitioner.</p>
          <p>Since similar medical services were not available near his home, John took a direct travelling route, and it was reasonable, under the circumstances, for him to travel to Germany to get medical services.</p>
          <p>John can claim all reasonable travel expenses for himself while en route, to and from Germany and for the one week period of medical services in Germany.</p>
